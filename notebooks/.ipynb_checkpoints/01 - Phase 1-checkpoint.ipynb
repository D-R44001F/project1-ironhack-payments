    "## Objectives Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of the project is to conduct a cohort analysis for IronHack Payments, with the following specific objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand user behavior** through key metrics defined by creation cohorts. (grupal) \n",
    "- **Identify patterns and trends** in the use of financial services, incident rates, and\n",
    "- revenue generation. (__)\n",
    "- **Propose and calculate an additional metric** that provides relevant insights into user performance or behavior.\n",
    "- **Deliver clear and practical outputs**, including an interactive dashboard and a concise presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How we going to do the job?\n",
    "- Use a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) by cleaning and consolidating the data sets.\n",
    "- Replicate the EDA and Analysis Preview process to confirm relevance information.\n",
    "- Use AGILE process, short Sprints at each hour.\n",
